## Description
To sharpen my front end web development skills, I created an online sudoku game using React.js. The web-app randomly selects one of fifty sudoku boards from an array and populates the board accordingly. Users can interact with the board by clicking on a square and incrementing itâ€™s value. Additionally, users can verify that their selections are valid at any time and can even have the board solved for them if they like. The solving mechanism was implemented via a backtracking algorithm which has the ability to solve any given sudoku board.
